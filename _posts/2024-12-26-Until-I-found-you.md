### Until I found you - Stephan Sanchez, Em Beihold

*Georgia, wrap me up in all your /*  
*I want you /*  
*In my arms /*  
*Oh, let me hold you /*  
*I'll never let you go again, like I did /*  
*Oh, I used to say*  

*I would never fall in love /*  
*again until I found her /*  
*I said I would never fall, /*  
*unless it's you I fall into /*  
*I was lost within the /*  
*darkness, but then I found her /*  
*I found you*  

*Heaven /*  
*When I held you again /*  
*How could /*  
*We ever just be friends? /*  
*I would /*  
*Rather die than let you go /*  
*Juliet to your Romeo /*  
*How I heard you say*  

*I would never fall in love /*  
*again until I found her /*  
*I said I would never fall, /*  
*unless it's you I fall into /*  
*I was lost within the /*  
*darkness, but then I found her /*  
*I found you*  

*I would never fall in love /*  
*again until I found her /*  
*I said I would never fall, /*  
*unless it's you I fall into /*  
*I was lost within the /*  
*darkness, but then I found her*  

*I found you*
