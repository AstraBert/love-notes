### Those eyes - New West


_When we're out in a crowd, laughing loud, and nobody knows why /_
_When we're lost at a club, getting drunk, and you give me that smile /_
_Going home in the back of a car and your hand touches mine /_
_When we're done making love and you look up and give me those eyes_

_'Cause all of the small things that you do /_
_Are what remind me why I fell for you /_
_And when we're apart and I'm missing you /_
_I close my eyes and all I see is you /_
_And the small things you do_

_When you call me at night while you're out getting high with your friends /_
_Every hi, every bye, every I love you you've ever said_

_'Cause all of the small things that you do /_
_Are what remind me why I fell for you /_
_And when we're apart and I'm missing you /_
_I close my eyes and all I see is you /_
_And the small things you do_

_When we're done making love and you look up and give me those eyes /_
_'Cause all of the small things that you do /_
_Are what remind me why I fell for you /_
_And when we're apart and I'm missing you /_
_I close my eyes and all I see is you /_
_And the small things you do /_
_All the small things you do /_
