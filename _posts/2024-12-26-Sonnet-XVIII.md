### Sonnet XVIII (Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?) - William Shakespeare

_Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?_
_Thou art more lovely and more temperate._
_Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,_
_And summer’s lease hath all too short a date._

_Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,_
_And often is his gold complexion dimmed;_
_And every fair from fair sometime declines,_
_By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;_

_But thy eternal summer shall not fade,_
_Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,_
_Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,_

_When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st._
_So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,_
_So long lives this, and this gives life to thee._
