### Butterflies - Aurora, Tom Odell

_When you touch me I feel butterflies /_
_I'm gonna love you till the day I die / _
_When you cut me, you cut me like a knife /_
_I wanna tell you, but I'm terrified_

_Oh, what a perfect day /_
_Why do you have to go away? /_
_Now the sky's so grey /_
_I think I'm gonna be okay? /_

_Be okay /_
_I'm gonna be okay /_
_I'm gonna be okay /_
_Am I gonna be okay? /_


_When you touch me I feel butterflies /_
